Freecell is a Solitaire-type game, which uses the regular deck of 52 suit-value cards. 
There are four suits: clubs (♣), diamonds (♦), hearts (♥), and spades (♠). 
Hearts and diamonds are colored red; clubs and spades are colored black. 
There are thirteen values: ace (written A), two through ten (written 2 through 10), jack (J), queen (Q) and king (K). 
In Freecell, aces are considered “low”, or less than a two. 
(In other games, they’re considered “high”, or greater than a king.)
